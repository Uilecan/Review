# Review
A mobile app where you can see reviews made by other people and you can review any product by your own.
You can upload pictures and videos regarding a specific product and you can review your experience with it. Your review can be seen by anyone. Basically, you donâ€™t have to check for Youtube reviews or sites that sell that specific product, you can search it here and see the best reviews. This implies a self-growing community for the app to work properly.

Description:
You need to create and account with a username and a password. The username can contain only letters from a-z and numbers from 1-10.
The password must be at least 8 characters long and must contain a number. You can also upload a profile picture under 5MB or you will be provided with a default profile picture.
You can also choose to login with the Facebook account and you will need to choose just a username. Once you login in the app you can choose to stay logged in or not.

On the main screen you will have at the bottom 4 buttons. One for the profile, on for upload, one for search and one for your own reviews.

The profile button will open a page where you can see your personal info such as username, picture and the number of uploads on the app.
The search button will enable a search bar where you can type keywords and search for reviews. The results will be displayed taking into consideration the ratings and the most recent ones.
The button for your own reviews will display the reviews made by the user using same interface for displaying reviews using the search bar.
The button for upload will open a display with a title, an option to upload pictures under 5MB each and videos under 50MB. You can write about the review as much as you want and you can enable the comments section or leave it disabled.

The main screen with the four buttons on the bottom will display the "hot" section of the app where the most controversial reviews will be displayed (the most viewed/rated ones or the reviews that people are taking a specific interest in at the moment).
Selecting a review made by someone else will show the title along with the pictures/videos and the text written. Beneath the review will be the comments section where you can leave a comment and also rate the review.
